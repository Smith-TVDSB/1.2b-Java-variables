# 1.2b-Java-variables
Create a Java program with an expected output screen

1. Use a string variable for the first name and last name
2. Use a char variable for middle initial (remember to use single quotes for char assignment i.e. char coinFlip = 'H';)
3. Use an int variable for age
4. Float for height (remember for float you put an f at the end of the assignment i.e. float price=19.99f;)
5. The output should look like this:  

Name:   Homer J. Simpson  
Age:    38  
Height: 1.8 meters
